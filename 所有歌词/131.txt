 use pretending things  still be right there's really nothing   say i'll  along   kiss tonight just close  door  walk away  never gonna fall  love again  don't want  start  someone new cause  couldn't bear  see  end just     no,  never want  feel  pain  remembering   used  be never gonna fall  love again just       first  thought  love  here  stay  summer made  seem  right but   sun  watched  fade away from morning  lonely night
