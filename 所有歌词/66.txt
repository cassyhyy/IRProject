don't  know  always happens same time every year. snow flakes  heartaches   lonesome christmas chill   keep  through emotions hiding from  truth don't  know  christmas just ain't christmas     know christmas hasn't been  same since  day  left.  still send  real tight greetings hoping someday  might forget   try  hold  tradition  all  things  used   but  know  christmas just ain't christmas  you.  cause all are having silent night memories    used  be  all  come back   world   just  santa bring  sweet love home  me.  there's  season  be happy but lord  feel  blue cause girl christmas just ain't christmas  you.
