i'm lying   hospital, i'm pinned against  bed.  stethoscope upon  heart,  hand against  head. they're peeling   bandages. i'm wincing   light.  nurse  looking anxious,  she's quivering  fright  i'm looking through gary gilmore's eyes.   doctors are avoiding me.  vision  confused.  listen   earphones,   catch  evening news.  murderer's been killed,   donates  sight  science. i'm locked   private ward.  realise    be  looking through gary gilmore's eyes.  looking through gary gilmore's eyes.   smash  light  anger. push  bed against  door.  close  lids across  eyes,  wish  see  more.  eye receives  messages,  sends    brain.  guarantee  stimuli  be perceived  same   looking through gary gilmore's eyes.  gary don't need  eyes  see. gary   eyes  parted company.
