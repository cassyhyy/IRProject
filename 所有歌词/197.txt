 i'm drowning   sunshine   falls down from  sky there's something stirring   heart, bright colours fill  eyes it's from here   far horizon  beauty  unfold  oh,  look  lovely, dressed  green  gold    almost touch  ocean, shimmering   distant haze   stand here   mountain   loveliest  days around half  world i've drifted, left  wild oats unsown but   view  shifted   think i've just come home    homeless   hungry,   always open doors   restless   weary find safe harbour   shores   always be  dreamtime place,  spirit's glad release   always be  shelter,   always live  peace   i'm drowning   sunshine   falls down from  sky there's something stirring   heart, bright colours fill  eyes it's from here   far horizon  beauty  unfold  oh,  look  lovely, dressed  green  gold
