i'm never fed up, because i'm made up, head full  loose change, because i'm rich  strange.  holy moses, here   again, headlong  some crazy scheme,  success    pipe dream,   remember how, wow   wow,   kiss  just  much.  from  cellar   house comes  bellowing, it's  tired  lonely tigers  i've kept there,  can't imagine   landlord's expecting, they've been   since june last year,   remember when,  loved    friend,   kiss  just   baby.    remember that, i'm fat but  know  it's at,   kiss  be   baby, let's     town.
