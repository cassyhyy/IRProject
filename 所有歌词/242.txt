could've told    really wanted  hear  could've stayed for another empty year  could've touched  hand   time  right but it's never right   eyes move away it's  wild, perfect day   should've never even    'cause  mouth  big but  words  thin 'cause something better than wanting    thought  being      mind moves away it's  wild, perfect day     world pass  it's joy, it's pain  fact  it's  lie  apathy,  say it's  wild it's  wild it's  wild  perfect day
