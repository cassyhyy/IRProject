 saw  blind man,    kind man, helping  fellow along, one   see, one   walk, but  both  humming  song;    you're smiling,  you're smiling,    world smiles  you,  you're laughing,  you're laughing,  sun comes shining through, but  you're crying  bring   rain,  stop  sighing be happy again, keep  smiling 'cause  you're smiling,   world smiles  you.    used  worry,  used  hurry, each time  started  rain,   see light, learned wrong from right,  you'll never hear  complain;    you're smiling,  you're smiling,    world smiles  you,  you're laughing,  you're laughing,  sun comes shining through, but  you're crying  bring   rain,  stop  sighing be happy again, keep  smiling 'cause  you're smiling,
