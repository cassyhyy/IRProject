   purple dusk  twilight time steals across  meadows   heart high    sky  little stars climb always reminding   we're apart  wander down  lane  far away leaving   song    die love    stardust  yesterday  music   years  by.   sometimes  wonder,   spend  lonely nights dreaming   song  melody  haunts  reverie    once again     love  new   each kiss  inspiration but   long ago    consolation    stardust   song  besides  garden wall,  stars are bright  are   arms  nightingale  tells  fairytale  paradise,  roses grew though  dream  vain   heart   remain  stardust melody  memory  love's refrain.
