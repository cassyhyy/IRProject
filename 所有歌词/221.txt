 tell   you're leavin',   can't believe it's true! girl, there's just  livin'  you. don't take  love away from me. don't  leave  heart  misery. 'cause   go, then i'll be blue, breakin'   hard  do.  remember   held  tight,   kissed  all through  night. think  all   been through,  breakin'   hard  do.   say  breakin'   hard  do,   know,  know  it's true. don't say     end. instead  breakin'   wish     makin'  again.   beg   don't say goodbye, can't    love just one  try? come  baby, let's start anew,  breakin'   hard  do.
