oh, danny boy,  pipes,  pipes are calling from glen  glen,  down  mountain side.  summer's gone,  all  roses falling, it's you, it's       bide.  but come ye back  summer's   meadow,    valley's hushed  white  snow, it's i'll be here  sunshine   shadow, oh, danny boy,  danny boy,  love  so!  but  ye come,  all  flowers are dying,    dead,  dead  well  be, you'll come  find  place    lying,  kneel  say  ave  for me.   shall hear, though soft  tread above me,  all  grave  warmer, sweeter be, for   bend  tell    love me,   shall sleep  peace until  come  me!
