day  day, i'm falling   love    day  day,  love seems  grow  isn't any end   devotion it's deeper, dear,  far than any ocean  find  day  day you're making all  dreams come true so, come  may,  want   know i'm  alone,  i'm  love  stay    through  years day  day i'm  alone,  i'm  love  stay    through  years day  day
