We push and pull like a magnet too

Although my heart is falling too

I'm in love with your body

And last night you were in my room

And now my bedsheets smell like you

Every day discovering something brand new

Well I'm in love with your body

Well I'm in love with your body

Well I'm in love with your body

Well I'm in love with your body

Every day discovering something brand new

I'm in love with the shape of you
