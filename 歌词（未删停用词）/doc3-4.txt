One week in we let the story begin

We're going out on our first date

But you and me are thrifty so go all you can eat

Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate

We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour

And how your family is doin' okay

And leave and get in a taxi, we kiss in the backseat

Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love

Your love was handmade for somebody like me

Come on now, follow my lead

I may be crazy, don't mind me, say

Boy, let's not talk too much

Grab on my waist and put that body on me

Come on now, follow my lead

Come¡ªcome on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
