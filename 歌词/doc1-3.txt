drowning in the study emptying the moon trying to empty out the ocean with  spoon up  up, up  up   people suffer   people part   people struggle   people break  heart break  heart yes  wanna know show me  to feel yes  wanna know show me  to heal it up, heal it up i��m trying to see the forest staring  every seed angels in the marble waiting to be freed, just need love just need love when the  is rough saying
