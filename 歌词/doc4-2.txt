i've become so numb,i can't feel  there i've become so tired,so much more aware i've becoming this,all  want to  is be more  me  be less   can't  see that you're smothering me holding too tightly,afraid to lose control cause everything that  thoughti would be  fallen apart right in front of  caught in the undertow,just caught in the undertow every step that  take is another mistake to  caught in the undertow,just caught in the undertow  every second  waste is more than   take
