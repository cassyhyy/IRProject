Dream beside me in the midnight glow, the lamp Is low
Dream and watch the shadows came and go, the lamp Is low
While you linger in my arms, my lips will sigh "I love you so" 
Dream the sweetest dream will ever know
Tonight the moon is high, the lamp Is low
 
Dream beside me in the midnight glow, the lamp Is low
Dream and watch the shadows came and go, the lamp Is low
While you linger in my arms, my lips will sigh "I love you so" 
Dream the sweetest dream will ever know
Tonight the moon is high, the lamp Is low
