How much rope you gonna give yourself?
How much slack do you need
In order not to hang yourself up on the street?
You say, you learned your lesson
But I know that that ain't true
When I see that feeling come over you

But I don't blame you, baby, 'cause it really ain't no use
I believe that you believe, you're searching for the truth
I don't know what hold that rounder downtown has on you
But keep on shaking, baby, till you shake yourself loose

I'm not running away from trouble, I'm walking away from an accident
Involving a personality double and a hole with a head in it
Ain't nothing I can say, ain't nothing I can do
When I see that feeling come over you

But I don't blame you, baby, 'cause it really ain't no use
I believe that you believe, you're searching for the truth
I don't know what hold that rounder downtown has on you
But keep on shaking, baby, till you shake yourself loose
