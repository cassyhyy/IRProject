I got a man with two left feet
And when he dances down to the beat
I really think that he should know
That his rhythms go, go, go

I got a man with two left feet
And when he dances down to the beat
I really think that he should know
That his rhythms go, go, go

Does he wash up? Never wash up
Does he clean up? No, he never cleans up
Does he brush up? Never brushed up
He does nothing, the boy does nothing

Does he wash up? Never wash up
Does he clean up? No, he never cleans up
Does he brush up? Never brushed up
He does nothing, the boy does nothing

Hey boy, how you been?
I got a thousand lines, where do I begin?
And I, I been here, been there traveling
I saw you at the corner, my vibe kicked in

And two fields, I clock you
Wearing tight jeans and real nice suit
He was smiling like you was just seventeen
I asked him for a dance, he said yes please

Take a sip of dancing juice, everybody's onto you
Through the left and to the right
Everybody hit the rhythm it's on tonight

I'm gonna feel the beat within my soul
I need a man to take control
Let the melody blow you all away

Does he wash up? Never wash up
Does he clean up? No, he never cleans up
Does he brush up? Never brushed up
He does nothing, the boy does nothing

Does he wash up? Never wash up
Does he clean up? No, he never cleans up
Does he brush up? Never brushed up
He does nothing, the boy does nothing

Work it out now, work it, work it out now
Do the mambo, shake it all around now
Everybody on the floor
Let me see you clap your hands

I wanna see you work
I wanna see you move your body and turn
I wanna see you shake your hips and learn
I wanna see you work it, work it, work it out now

Hey, I wanna see you work
I wanna see you move your body and turn
I wanna see you shake your hips and learn
I wanna see you work it, work it, work it out now

Does he wash up? Never wash up
Does he clean up? No, he never cleans up
Does he brush up? Never brushed up
He does nothing, the boy does nothing

Does he wash up? Never wash up
Does he clean up? No, he never cleans up
Does he brush up? Never brushed up
He does nothing, the boy does nothing

And if the man can't dance
He gets no second chance
And if the man can't dance
He gets no second chance

And if the man can't dance
He gets no second chance
And if the man can't dance
He gets no second chance

And if the man can't dance
He gets no second chance
And if the man can't dance
He gets no second chance
