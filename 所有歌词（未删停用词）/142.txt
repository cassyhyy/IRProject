I'm Lazy when I'm loving 
I'm Lazy when I play 
I'm lazy with my girlfriend, a thousand times a day 
I'm lazy when I'm speakin 
I'm lazy when I walk 
I'm lazy when I'm dancin 
I'm lazy when I talk 

Open up my mouth 
Air comes rushin out 
Nothin doin nada never how you like me now? 
Wouldn't it be mad, wouldn't it be fine 
Lazy lucky lady dancin lovin all the time 

Ohh , I'm wicked and I'm lazy 
Ohh, Don't you want to save me? 

I'm lazy, lazy, lazy, lazy 

There's some folks they got money &amp; 
Some folks life is sweet 
Some folks make decisions &amp; 
Some folks clean the street 

Now, Imagine what it feels like 
Imagine how it sounds 
Imagine life is perfect and every thing works out 

No tears are falling from my eyes 
I'm keepin all the pain inside 
Now don't you want to live with me? 
I'm lazy as a man can be 

Ohh , I'm wicked and I'm lazy 
Ohh, Don't you want to save me 

I'm lazy, lazy, lazy, lazy 

Imagine there's a girlfriend 
Imagine there's a job 
Imagine there's an answer 
Imagine there's a God 
Imagine I'm a Devil 
Imagine I'm a Saint 
Lazy money, lazy sexy, lazy outa space 

No tears are falling from my eyes 
I'm keepin all the pain inside 
Now don't you want to live with me? 
I'm lazy as a man can be 

Ohh , I'm wicked and I'm lazy 
Ohh, Don't you want to save me 

Lazy when I work 
Lazy all the day 
Screamin all you like but it only fades away 
I'm lazy when I'm prayin 
Lazy on the job 
Gota lazy mind, a lazy eye, a lazy lazy bod 

Hard men, Hard Lives, Hard keepin it all inside 
Good times, Good God, I'm so Lazy I almost stop 

Ohh , I'm wicked and I'm lazy 
Ohh, Don't you want to save me 

I'm lazy, lazy, lazy, lazy 

Ohh , I'm wicked and I'm lazy 
Ohh, Don't you want to save me
