I've been looking for a place to fit
Where I can speak my mind
I've been trying hard to find the people
That I won't leave behind
They say I've got brains
But they ain't doing me no good
I wish they would
Each time things start to happen again
I think I've got something good going for myself
But what goes wrong
Sometimes I feel very sad
Sometimes I feel very sad
Sometimes I feel very sad
Oh I guess I just wasn't made for these times

Every time I get the inspiration
To go change things round
No one wants to help me look for places
Where new things can be found
Where can I turn
When my fair weather friends drop out
What's it all about
Each time things start to happen again
I think I've got something good going for myself
But what goes wrong
Sometimes I feel very sad
Sometimes I feel very sad
Sometimes I feel very sad
I guess I just wasn't made for these times

Sometimes I feel very sad
Sometimes I feel very sad
Sometimes I feel very sad

I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
Oh I wasn't made for these times
I wasn't made
I guess I just wasn't
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
