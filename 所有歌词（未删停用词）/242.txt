Could've told you what you really wanted to hear
I could've stayed for another empty year
I could've touched your hand when the time was right
But it's never right
And your eyes move away
It's a wild, perfect day

I should've never even let you in
'Cause your mouth was big
But your words were thin
'Cause something better than wanting you
Is the thought of being done with you
And my mind moves away
It's a wild, perfect day

We let the world pass by
it's joy, it's pain
The fact that it's a lie
The apathy, I say
It's a wild it's a wild
It's a wild and perfect day
