The club isn't the best place to find a lover

So the bar is where I go

Me and my friends at the table doing shots

Drinking faster and then we talk slow

Come over and start up a conversation with just me

And trust me I'll give it a chance now

Took my hand, stop, prepare "The Man" on the jukebox

And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
