Me with the floorshow
Kickin' with your torso
Boys getting high
And the girls even more so
Wave your hands if you're not with the man
Can I kick it (yes you can)
I got (funk)
You got (soul)
We got everybody
I've got the gift
Gonna stick it in the goal
It's time to move your body

Babylon back in business
Can I get a witness
Every girl every man
Houston, do you hear me?
Ground control, can you feel me?
Need permission to land

I don't want to rock, DJ
But you're making me feel so nice
When's it gonna stop, DJ?
'Cause you're keepin' me up all night

Singin' in the classes
Music for your masses
Give no head
No backstage passes
Have a proper giggle
I'll be quite polite
But when I rock the mike
I rock the mike (right)
You got no love then you're with the wrong man
It's time to move your body
If you can't get a girl but your best friend can
It's time to move your body

I don't want to be sleazy
Baby, just tease me
Got no family planned
Houston, do you hear me?
Ground control, can you feel me?
Need permission to land

I don't want to rock (rock), DJ (DJ)
But you're making me feel so nice
When's it gonna stop (stop), DJ?
'Cause you're keepin' me up all night

I don't want to rock (rock), DJ (DJ)
But you're making me feel so nice
When's it gonna stop (stop), DJ (DJ)?
'Cause you're keepin' me up all night

Pimpin' ain't easy
Most of them fleece me
Every night
Pimpin' ain't easy
But if you're sellin' it (sellin' it, sellin' it)
It's alright

(Come on)

I don't want to rock (rock), DJ (DJ)
But you're making me feel so nice
When's it gonna stop (stop), DJ (DJ)?
'Cause you're keepin' me up all night

I don't want to rock (rock), DJ (DJ)
But you're making me feel so nice
When's it gonna stop (stop), DJ (DJ)?
'Cause you're keepin' me up all night

I don't want to rock, DJ
But you're making me feel so nice
When's it gonna stop (stop), DJ?
'Cause you're keepin' me up all night

I don't want to rock (rock), DJ
But you're making me feel so nice
When's it gonna stop (stop), DJ (DJ)?
'Cause you're keepin' me up all night
