I'm searching through emptiness
And try to forget us in vain
The light of the dark setting sun
Will bring my sadness to an end

Voices cry out through the fear and the dark
As we wait for our lives to be better

The words are dying in the night
No winter lasts forever
The seasons pass and the sunlight will shine
On my life again

So let the past now burn down in flames Ooohh

Locked in prison, in a world of living fear
On the edge of my destruction, marching on
Still suffering darkness in the dreams of life not meant to be
As I lie awake and curse the rising sun

Sadness in time for the truth that she hides
And this pain in my heart for no reason

The words are dying in the night
No winter lasts forever
The seasons pass and the sunlight will shine
On my life again

So let the past now burn down in flames

Stare into my eyes
I'm burning with lust and desire
Wont you come down and
Let yourself go in the fire
So leave the past behind

Voices cry out through the fear and the dark
As we wait for our lives to be better

The words are dying in the night
No winter lasts forever
The seasons pass and the sunlight will shine
On my life again

So leave the past behind

The dark clouds fading for my mind
No pain will last forever
The seasons pass and the sunlight will shine
On my life again
So let the past now burn down in flames
Now burn down in flames
