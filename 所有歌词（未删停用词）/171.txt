I used to live my life just fast and free, and do as I feel
Right down to the bone I was a rolling stone, just want to be free
But now I think I might be just a little more than slightly, changing my views
This is a far cry from what I've known, cause all I know is I want

Only to be with you (Yeah)
'Cause through and through
I'm just a freak for you

Nobody's want to make me stay this long, the way that you do
Turn your love on and I feel I'm reborn, I always want you
Sometimes I feel like hey this can't be right, this cannot be real
I've seen love come and I've seen it go, cause all I know is I want

Only to be with you 
'Cause through and through
I'm just a freak for you
Only to be with you (Yeah)
'Cause trough and trough
Girl I believe in you

Sometimes I feel like hey no this cannot be right, this cannot be real
And I feel like I've seen the light, 'cause all I know that I want

Only to be with you 
'Cause through and through
I'm just a freak for you
Only to be with you (Yeah)
'Cause through and through
Girl I believe in you

Do you know what I'm talking about
Make my world go round

Only, only, only, only
Only, only, only, only

Only to be with you
Only to be with you
