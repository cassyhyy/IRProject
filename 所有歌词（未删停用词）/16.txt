I've become so numb,I can't feel you there
I've become so tired,so much more aware
I've becoming this,all I want to do
Is be more like meand be less like you
I¡¯ve become so numb,I can¡¯t feel you there
Is everything what you want me to be
I¡¯ve become so numb,I can¡¯t feel you there
Is everything what you want me to be
