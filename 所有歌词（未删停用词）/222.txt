Information is like meds
They pump us full of them
I can't trust my own eyes anymore
I think I can't trust my own eyes anymore

The collapse of history!

Well, are you going to act or will you just stare at your screen to hours on end?
Must another crisis move another generation to action?

The collapse of history
The collapse of history
Press forward-escape and watch it collapse! hey!

Oh the collapse of history!

All this adrenaline is messing with my head
All this adrenaline is messing with my head
I want to become a threat
To no one but myself! hey!

The collapse of history
The collapse of history
The collapse of history
Press forward-escape and watch it collapse! hey!

Oh the collapse of history!

Activities crystallize in front of my eyes
Histories plasticize in front of my eyes
Conspiracies trivialize in front of my eyes
I can feel it rumbling in my mind! hey

The collapse of history
Press forward escape and watch it collapse! hey!

Oh the collapse of history!
