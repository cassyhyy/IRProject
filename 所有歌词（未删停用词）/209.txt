Still is still moving to me 
And I swim like a fish in the sea all the time
But if that's what it takes to be free I don't mind
Still is still moving to me 
Still is still moving to me
And it's hard to explain how I feel
It won't go in words but I know that it's real
I can be moving or I can be still 
But still is still moving me
Still is still moving to me

And it's hard to explain how I feel 
It won't go in words but I know that it's real
I can be moving or I can be still
But still is still moving me 
Still is still moving to me

And it's hard to explain how I feel 
It won't go in words but I know that it's real
I can be moving or I can be still
But still is still moving me 
Still is still moving to me 
Still is still moving to me 
Still is still moving to me
