How glad the many millions
Of Annabelle's and Lilian's
Would be, to capture me
But you had such persistence
You wore down my resistance
I fell, and it was swell
I'm your big and brave and handsome Romeo
How I won you I shall never, never know
It's not that I'm attractive
But oh, my heart grew active
When you came into view

I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
All the day and nighttime, hear me sigh
I never had the least notion
That I could fall with so much emotion

Could you coo, could you care
For a lovely cottage that, do you wanna meet Monday to pick up the forniture
The world will pardon my mush
'Cause I have got a crush, my baby, on you

Could you coo, there you go again, could you care, now wait a minute
For a lovely cottage that we could share
The world will pardon my mush
But I have got a crush, my baby, on you, oh yeah
