Drowning in the study emptying the moon
Trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon
Up and up, up and up
How can people suffer how can people part
How can people struggle how can people break your heart
Break your heart
Yes I wanna know show me how to feel
Yes I wanna know show me how to heal it up, heal it up
I¡¯m trying to see the forest staring at every seed
Angels in the marble waiting to be freed, just need love
Just need love when the going is rough saying
