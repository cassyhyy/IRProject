I don't hang around that place no more
I'm tired of wearing circles in the floor
And I don't carry myself very well
I've gotten so much braver
Can you tell

I'm happy
Can't you see
I'm alright
But I miss you Amber Lee

And I line my secrets up all one by one
I put 'em all away when I was done
And I would really love to hear your voice sometime
To close a little distance in my mind

I'm happy
Can't you see
I'm alright
But I miss you Amber Lee
Amber Lee

Where have you been all these years
And how could you just disappear
And when did you stop
Missing me

I'm happy
Can't you see
I'm alright
But I miss you Amber Lee

I'm alright
But I miss you Amber Lee
