We¡¯re gonna get it, get it together
I know we¡¯re gonna get it
Get it together somehow
We¡¯re gonna get it, get it together and flower, oooh
We¡¯re gonna get it, get it together, I know we¡¯re gonna get it
Get it together and flow
We¡¯re gonna get it, get it together and oh up
Cause you can say what is
Power through it, close your mind
Clench your fist, you can change minds
Take the risk, or see each soul like happiness
