If you gave me a chance

It's a shot in the dark

Know with all of your heart

When I am with you there's no place I'd rather

We're a thousand miles from comfort we have traveled land and sea

But as long as you are with me there's no place I'd rather be

I would wait forever exalted in the scene

As long as I am with you my heart continues to beat

With every step we take Kyoto to The Bay

Strolling so casually
