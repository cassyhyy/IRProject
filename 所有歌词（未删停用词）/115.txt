I'll have to see my broker, 
Find out what he can do, 
'Cause I'm in the market for you.

There won't be any joker, 
With margin I'm all through, 
'Cause I want you outright, it's true.

You're going up, up, up in my estimation, 
I want a thousand shares of your caresses, too.

We'll count the hugs and kisses, 
When dividends are due, 
'Cause I'm in the market for you!
