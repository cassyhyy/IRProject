I got a fox
You know I treat her right
Don't have to stay out
Walk the streets at night

I treat her good
Like a good man should
Got a lot of love to give
And I don't have to stay out

And walk the streets
And I feel alright
I got a flower

You know I treat her right
Give her lots of love
I gotta soul full of light
When it gets cold
I can keep her warm
Give her shade from the heat
Shelter from the storm
Gonna give her lots of love

And light
Make her feel alright
When I'm getting restless
And I want to play
If she said she didn't mind
She'd be jealous anyway
Cause we get spring fever

Every now and then
Virtue in my heart
Vice in my hands
When she's getting restless

And she wants to play
If I said I didn't mind
I'd be jealous anyway
Cause we get spring fever

Every now and then
I've got virtue in my heart
And in my hand
