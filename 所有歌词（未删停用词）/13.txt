I¡¯m tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless,lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
Caught in the undertow,just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow,just caught in the undertow
