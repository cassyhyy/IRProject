Who knows your birthday
Who knows your number
Who knows your color
Who knows your hands
Who knows the sum
The sum of all your parts

Who knows your limit
Who knows your highest
Who knows your lowest
Who knows your in
Who knows that bottom
The bottom of your heart

Hold on hold on
Keep holding on to me
I will love you from the bottom
No one holds you better than me
Hold on hold on
Doing the best we can
I will love you on your birthday
I will love you better than them

Who knows the reason
Who knows the cure
Who knows the answer
Who knows the cause
Who knows the pain
The pain when we're apart

Hold on hold on
Keep holding on to me
I will love you from the bottom
No one holds you better than me
Hold on hold on
Doing the best we can
I will love you on your birthday
I will love you better than them
