I've become so numb,I can't feel you there
I've become so tired,so much more aware
I've becoming this,all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
Can't you see that you're smothering me
Holding too tightly,afraid to lose control
Cause everything that you thoughtI would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you
Caught in the undertow,just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow,just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take
