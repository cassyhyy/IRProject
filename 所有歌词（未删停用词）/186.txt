Your world full of creeps
Zombies walk the street
9 to 5 barely alive
Have a beer go to sleep
And start all over again

Same gray suit
Same brown shoes
Same headache
Same pills
He goes home thinks about suicide
But he's got his diploma, ya got to give him that

I got a radical place
Got my own private space
It's my sanctuary
It's the castle of doom
I'm the king of my room
Just a Quasimodo
Let the world blow away
This is where I will stay
In my sanctuary
Got my mess on the floor
Got my lock on my door

Go Away, Sanctuary
Go Away, Sanctuary

Someday I gotta get outta here
Gotta put on a shirt put on a tie
Get a job buy a car get some insurance
'Cause I'll probably have a heart attack by the time I'm 40

I guess I'll find the perfect wife
And I'll have 2.3 perfect kids
And if I work real hard
And if I die real fast
They'll all turn out just like me

I got a radical place
Got my own private space
It's my sanctuary
It's the castle of doom
I'm the king of my room
Just a Quasimodo
Let the world blow away
This is where I will stay
In my sanctuary
Got my mess on the floor
Got my lock on my door

Go Away, Sanctuary
Go Away, Sanctuary
Go Away, Sanctuary
Go Away, Sanctuary

I got a radical place
Got my own private space
It's my sanctuary
It's a castle of doom
I'm the king of my room
Just a Quasimodo
Let the world blow away
This is where I will stay
In my sanctuary
Got my mess on the floor
Got my lock on my door

Go Away, Sanctuary
Go Away, Sanctuary
Go Away, Sanctuary
Go Away, Sanctuary
