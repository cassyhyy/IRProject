Now I'm drowning in the sunshine as it falls down from the sky
There's something stirring in my heart, bright colours fill my eyes
It's from here to the far horizon your beauty does unfold
And oh, you look so lovely, dressed in green and gold

I can almost touch the ocean, shimmering in the distant haze
As I stand here on this mountain on this loveliest of days
Around half the world I've drifted, left no wild oats unsown
But now my view has shifted and I think I've just come home

To the homeless and the hungry, may we always open doors
May the restless and the weary find safe harbour on our shores
May you always be our dreamtime place, a spirit's glad release
May you always be our shelter, may we always live in peace

Now I'm drowning in the sunshine as it falls down from the sky
There's something stirring in my heart, bright colours fill my eyes
It's from here to the far horizon your beauty does unfold
And oh, you look so lovely, dressed in green and gold
