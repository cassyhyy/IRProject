No no no no place I rather be

No no no no place I rather be

No no no no place I rather be

When I am with you there's no place I rather

We set out on a mission to find our inner peace

Make it ever lasting so nothing's incomplete

It's easy being with you sacred simplicity

As long as we're together there's no place I rather be

With every step we take Kyoto to The Bay

Strolling so casually
