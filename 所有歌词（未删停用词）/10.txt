Girl, you know I want your love

Your love was handmade for somebody like me

Come on now, follow my lead

I may be crazy, don't mind me, say

Boy, let's not talk too much

Grab on my waist and put that body on me

Come on now, follow my lead

Come¡ªcome on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
