Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree, for me
I've been an awful good girl,
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby, a 54 convertible too, light blue
I'll wait up for you dear
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

Think of all the fun I've missed,
Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed
Next year I could be just as good,
If you'd check out my Christmas list

Santa baby, I want a yacht,
And really that's not a lot
I've been an angel all year
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa honey, one thing that I really need, the deed
To a plex of my
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa cutie, fill my stocking with a toplex, and checks
Sign your 'X' on the line
Santa cutie, and hurry down the chimney tonight

Come and trim my Christmas tree,
With some decorations bout at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me
(Boo doo bee doo)

Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing, a ring
I don't mean on the phone,
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight,
Hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry, tonight
