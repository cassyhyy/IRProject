Looking you over
And you don't know my name yet
But by the time you looked away
Already knew I couldn't fake it

I got this need for you
Forming in my beating heart
I knew the meaning right away
We only yesterday, were worlds apart

I think I may love you
If you give me some time,
Maybe you'll love me too

I got this thing for you
If you come closer I can whisper in your ear
And if you wanna walk away
I'll tell you all the things I know you wanna hear.

I'll come closer
To you if you
Come over
I know we'll go farther
Farther with you
With you I'm in warm water swimming down.

I think I may love you, if you give me some time,
Maybe you'll love me too

I'll come closer
To you if you
Come over
I know we'll go farther
Farther with you
With you I'm in warm water swimming down.

I'll come closer
To you if you
Come over
I know we'll go farther
Farther with you
With you I'm in warm water swimming down.
