I haven't got any money but my heart is pure.
If it's love that you want baby
I'm the one you're looking for.
I can't give you diamonds,
But I can make you smile.
He only wants to buy you, honey,
I want to drive you wild, wild,

Let me hold you always in my heart forever,
I love you.

I know he might be patient
And he may seem kind
But I know guys like him,
They've got a one track mind.
So if you're looking for something
To fill your heart
I swear to you right now,
I'll never let us be apart, apart

And I will hold you always in my heart forever,
I love you.

I love you so much that it burns in my skin
To watch him mistreat you and never let you in.
So when the moment comes to prove myself to you
I will not let you down, I will always love you true.
I will. I will always love you true.

I know it's all my fault that I'm your second choice.
If you were here with me, my heart it would rejoice.
Lay on my shoulder, I'll hold you close tonight.
Let the teardrops fall, there's nothing left to hide, hide,

Let me hold you always in my heart, forever,
I love you.

I will. I will always love you true.
I will. I will always love you true.
