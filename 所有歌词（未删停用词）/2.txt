Underneath the storm an umbrella is saying
Sitting with the boys takes away the pain
Up and up up and up
We're gonna get it get it together
I know we're gonna get it get it together somehow
We're gonna get it get it together and fly
We're gonna get it get it together
I know we're gonna get it get it together and float
We're gonna get it get it together and go
Up and up and up
