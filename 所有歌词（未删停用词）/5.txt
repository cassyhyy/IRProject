I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing:
"Now the old king is dead
Long live the king "
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt pillars of sand
