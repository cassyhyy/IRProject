Nick just waits to fly
Easy to take
You could take me in for us
Make me a deal
A day apiece
Take it off, just stay a week

I'll take you in pieces
We can take it all apart
I've softened shipwrecks right from the start
I've been underwater
Breathin' out and in
I think I'm losin' where you end and I begin

Basic space
Openin'
Don't look away
When there's nothin'
There

I'm setting us in stone
Piece by piece before I'm alone
Air tight before we break
Keep it in
Keep us safe

This pool of boiling wax
I'm giving in that is sick
Got to fill this in
Gotta just?
Why don't we learn how to keep what I have
Preserved

Basic space
Openin'
Don't look away
When there's nothin'
There

Hot wax
Has left me with a sign
Wouldn't know if I've been left behind
Second skin
Second skin

I can let it out
I still let you in
I can let it out
I still let you in
