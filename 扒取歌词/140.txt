Got dust on my piano
And dishes in the sink
Your side of the bed is cold
I haven't slept a wink
So I read your goodbye letter
To the face inside my drink
Lay me down and roll me out to sea

Got your picture in my wallet
And some pictures in my mind
A pocketful of memories
I never thought I'd find
And it's rainin' like a Monday
And the world seems so unkind
So lay me down and roll me out to sea

[Chorus]
Lay me down, roll me out to sea
Calling on a mighty wave to cover me
Lay me down
Roll me out to sea
Heaven, if you're ready shine your light on me

Now listen to my story
Cause I haven't told it all
I saw her with her new love
She turned to me and called
When they asked, "How ya' doing?"
I could crumbled like a wall
So lay me down and roll me out to sea
