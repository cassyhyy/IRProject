Waiting
Upon the dunes of earth and sand
In the morning
The flame appears upon your hand
Swallow
The fears of empty promise hearts
And remember
We only just got to the stars

Save the dying arms of midnight
For the patience and or lapse of light
'Cause it¡¯s our time in the universe
Well I don¡¯t mind
If we're blessed or cursed
And it¡¯s our time in the universe
Yours and mine

Breathing
Beneath miles of earth and sky
And in sunlight
I will appear before your eyes
So don¡¯t worry
On what tomorrow holds for you
I¡¯ll be waiting
At the end of every road you choose

Save the dying arms of midnight
'Cause it¡¯s our time in the universe
Well I don¡¯t mind
If we're blessed or cursed
Well it¡¯s our time in the universe
Yours and mine

See you don¡¯t fall
No matter the end
See it unfold no matter the need
See it fold up whatever happens to be
It¡¯s what it will be
It¡¯s what it will be

'Cause it¡¯s our time in the universe
Well I don¡¯t mind
If we're blessed or cursed
Yeah it¡¯s our time in the universe
Yours and mine
Yours and mine
