I am praying for my brother to be brave when he's sailing 'cross the sea
I am praying for my mother not to cry and to be so depressed
I just want to believe when the war is away
He'll be back, stars will show the way

I am praying for the fortune not to leave him while he's in open sea
I am praying to the Deity, late at night send winds, fill the sails

Let the storms will pursue distant foe all the time
Stars will mark the way with their shine

Sail through blockade, the ship of the only hope
Pass the fleet at moment the mist is rising
Sail through blockade, the ship of the only hope
Pass the fleet at moment the mist is rising
