Say there's a girl
Who's new in town
Well you better watch out now
Or she'll put you down
'Cause she's an evil chick
Say she's the witch

She got long black hair
And a big black car
I know what you're thinking
But you won't get far
She gonna make you itch
'Cause she's the witch

Well, she walks around late at night
Most other people sleeping tight
If you hear her knocking on your door
You better sneak away

Now you know the score
'Cause I set you straight
But you better be careful
Before it's too late
She gonna make you itch
'Cause she's the witch

She walks around late at night
Most other people sleeping tight
If you hear her knocking on your door
You better stay awake

Well you know you will
Say don't you know
And do you remember
That I told you so
Gonna do you in
'Cause she's the witch

Ah hoo
Ah hoo
