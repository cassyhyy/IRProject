Wrong
Would it be wrong to kiss
Seeing I feel like this
Would it be wrong to try?

Wrong
Would it be wrong to stay
Here in your arms this way
Under this starry sky?

If it is wrong
Then why were you sent to me
Why am I content to be
With you forever?

So
When I need you so much
And I have waited so long
It must be right
It can't be wrong
