Seek and destroy all you have 'cause I know
Brother your fears and my tears 'cause you know
And all I have now is being here with you

Seek and destroy all you have cas I know
Cause I know know right now
They will never be tuning in
To what we know

And all I have now is being here with you
Cover your fear it's all we know
Cover your fear it's all we know
And all I have now
Is being here with you
