Somehow something stocks
I can stand the low end
Things gotta move on up
I want land where I can't
And I don't wanna stop
Being your friend
Your right hand
I make my day
This is my way
I gotta move on

But I open my door
For your heart and your butt
See I got enough chores
And my art keeps me smart
There ain't no better source
The end is hard so I start
I make my day
This is my way
I gotta move on

Go on
You are strong get it done
So long
Move on

Still you are the one I need
Hope you see all of me
I got to plant my seed
With somebody loving me
'Cause I like to breath
If you don't care
I get nowhere
What's up out there
Come on let's share
Our show must go on

Seems as you don't know what
You want to do but I do
'Cause I've written this plat
A sure shot that moves odd
But without you its not
The same crew its on you
What's up out there
Come on let's share
Our show must go on

Go on
You are strong get it done
So long
Move on

Go on
You are strong get it done
So long
Move on

You've got it, you've got it
