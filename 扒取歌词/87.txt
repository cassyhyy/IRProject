I know that you've been hurt before 
 but baby 
 you won't be hurt again no 
 'cause I'm a different man 
 I wish you could understand 
 baby take my hand 
 Chorus: 
 Leave the past behind 
 for this wonder 
 Don't look back again 
 Can't you see this start might be a new beginning now 
 For your broken heart 
 I promise you'll be safe with me 
 forever you'll never be alone 
 I know the pain you feel 
 I know that broken hearts can heel 
 I can make it real 
 Chorus 
 When I hold you in my arms 
 When I feel you understand me 
 Nothing else makes sense at all 
 When you're far away from home 
 When you say that you are lonely 
 This is for your broken heart 
 Chorus
