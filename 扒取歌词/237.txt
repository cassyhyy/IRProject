We are the nights that are wasted and lost
Nights that arrive in a rush
We are the nights that are covered in dust
Nights that are rhythm by life
And even when the night is over
We keep the feeling inside
We're gonna make it last forever
Like every moment is now or never

We are we are we are the nights
We are we are we are the nights
We are we are we are the nights
We are we are we are the nights

We are we are we are

We are the nights that are wasted and lost
Nights that arrive in a rush
We are the nights that are covered in dust
Nights that are rhythm by life
And even when the night is over
We keep the feeling inside
We're gonna make it last forever
Like every moment is now or never

We are we are we are the nights
We are we are we are the nights
We are we are we are the nights
We are we are we are the nights

We are we are we are
