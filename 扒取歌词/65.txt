Come on and sing the Chica Chica Boom Chic
That crazy thing, the Chica Chica Boom Chic
Brazilians found the Chica Chica Boom Chic
They like the sound of Chica Chica Boom Chic
It came down the Amazon from the jungles
Where the natives greet ev'ry one they meet beatin' on a tom tom
Boom chi-boom chi-boom, boom chi-boom chi-boom,

It don't make sense, The Chica Chica Boom Chic
But it's immense, the Chica Chica Boom Chic
That's all you've got to say to chase the jinx away
Chica Chica Boom, Chica Chica Boom
Chica Chica Boom Chic! Boom Chic!
