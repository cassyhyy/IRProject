Days swiftly come and go.
I'm dreaming of her
She's seeing other guys
Emotions they stir
The sun is gone.
The nights are long
And I am left while the tears fall

Did you think that I would cry,
On the phone?
Do you know what it feels like,
Being alone?
I'll find someone new

(Swing) swing, swing from the tangles of
My heart is crushed by a former love.
Can you help me find a way
To carry on again

Wish cast into the sky
I'm moving on
Sweet beginnings do arise
She knows I was wrong
The notes are old,
They bend, they fold
And so do I to a new love

Did you think that I would cry,
On the phone?
Do you know what it feels like,
Being alone?
I'll find someone new

(Swing) swing, swing from the tangles of
My heart is crushed by a former love.
Can you help me find a way
To carry on again

Bury me
(You thought your problems were gone)
Carry me
(Away, away, away)

(Swing) swing, swing from the tangles of
My heart is crushed by a former love.
Can you help me find a way

To carry on again
To carry on again
To carry on again
