Love, you didn't do right by me
You planned a romance that just hadn't a chance
And I'm through

Love, you didn't do right by me
I'm back on the shelf and I'm blaming myself
But it's you

My one love affair didn't get anywhere from the start
To send me a Joe who had winter and snow in his heart
Wasn't smart

Love, you didn't do right by me
As they say in the song
"You done me wrong!"
