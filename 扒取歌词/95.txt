Don't have no penthouse in Dallas
No beach house in Malibu
Guess I'm not livin' the good life
Like we're all supposed to do

All I got's a little trailer
In the corner of this fancy sandy lot
And I'm getting really tired
Of hearing who I oughta be and hearing who I'm not

And I gotta get away, gotta get away
I don't want to be like this
Want to feel like this
Take what we can and run away
Gotta get away, gotta get away
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

They tell you, you're too skinny
Tellin' you, you're too fat
Say you gotta buy this thing, Lord
Say you gotta have that

Been drinking too much coffee
Drinking way too much beer
Sittin' on my old couch, watching free TV
Tryin' to find a way and now to break on out of here

And I gotta get away, gotta get away
I don't want to be like this
Want to feel like this
Take what we can and run away
Gotta get away, gotta get away
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Thumbs up, thumbs down
That's the rule that we're livin' by now
One day you're in, the next day you're not
One day you're cold, then the next year you're hot
Gotta be sexy I was come in first
Read it in the magazines, it's only getting worse

And I gotta get away, gotta get away
I don't want to be like this
Want to feel like this
Take what we can and run away
Gotta get away, gotta get away
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, hoo, oh, oh, hoo
Oh, hoo, oh, oh, hoo
