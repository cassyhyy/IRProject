I could draw your fingerprints
And all the shades around your shoulder
I could paint your silhouette
And every cell I touch when I hold you

And now I see you cry
Just like a fading light
You're giving up and you're
Falling apart

But piece by piece
I'll put you back together
The words you said
I remember every letter
I know you by heart, I know all you are
So when you're falling apart
I will put you together
Piece by piece

Every dream you ever told
I wrote them down to save your sad eyes
Your bruise and break but that's OK
The finest things are always fragile

I know you find it hard
That's just the way you are
I'll be here when you're falling apart

But piece by piece
I'll put you back together
The words you said
I remember every letter
I know you by heart, I know all you are
So when you're falling apart
I will put you back together

Oh oh

But piece by piece 
I'll put you back together
The words you said
I remember every letter
I know you by heart, I know all you are
So when you're falling apart
I will put you back together
Piece by piece

Piece by piece
