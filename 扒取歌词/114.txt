I was a fool to step aside
And let you run to someone new
But I won't be a fool anymore
I'm coming back to you

Can't bear to think you're kissing her
It tortures me the whole night through
But I won't take that torture anymore
I'm coming back to you
I'm coming back to you

She's got no right to hold you tight
Her days are over, beginning tonight

Your lips belong to me alone
No one could love you like I do
And I can't live without you anymore
I'm coming back to you
I'm coming back to you

Your lips belong to me alone
No one could love you like I do
And I can't live without you anymore
I'm coming back to you
I'm coming back to you

I'm coming back to you
I'm coming back
