Hear my voice
Where you are
Take a train
Steal a car

Hop a freight
Grab a star
Come back to me
Catch a plane

Catch a breeze
On your hands
On your knees
Swim or fly only please

Come back to me
On a mule in a jet
With your hair in a net
Or a towel wringin' wet

I don't care
This is where
You should be
From the hills

From the shore
Ride the wind to my door
Turn highways to dust
Break the law if you must

Move the world only just
Come back to me
Have you gone to the moon
Or the corner saloon

And to rack and ruin
Mademoiselle
Where the hell
Can you be?

In a crate
In a trunk
On a horse
On a drunk

In a Rolls or a van
Wrapped in Mink or Saran
Any way that you can
Come back to me

Bring it on back
