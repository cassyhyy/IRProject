I can't stand the rain 
Against my window 
Bringing back sweet memories 

Hey, window pane 
Do you remember 
How sweet it used to be 

When we was together 
Everything was so grand 
Now that we've parted 
There's just one sound 
That I just can't stand 

I can't stand the rain 
Against my window 
Bringing back sweet memories 

I can't stand the rain 
Against my window 
'Cause he's not here with me 

Alone with the pillow 
Where his head used to lay 
I know you've got 
Some sweet memories 
But like the window 
You ain't got nothing to say 

I can't stand the rain 
Against my window 
Bringing back sweet memories 

I can't stand the rain 
Against my window 
Just keeps on haunting me 

Hey, rain 
Get off my window
