The red light of the sun
Slowly descending
The sky is all I see
It's never ending

We could fly
You and I
On a cloud
Kissing, kissing

The wind plays with the leaves
The weather turns colder
But as long as we believe
Love doesn't get older

We could fly
You and I
On a cloud
Kissing, kissing

On a journey of the heart
There's so much to see
And when the sky is dark
You'll be right here
Right here with me

Right here with me
Kissing

On a journey of the heart
Kissing
