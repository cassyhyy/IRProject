A perfect stranger on your mind
A hero on his chariot
He is coming, coming for you
To take away your dreams
The dreams of a fairytale
Where we all know the end
But it remains a fairytale
Welcome to reality!

He's the devil in disguise
The one with the healing hand
He will talk a universe of lies
Just to get you in his land

They take away this certain sense
When you were still so young
But nothing's suppressed and lost forever
Just hidden below the surface

He's the devil in disguise
The one with the healing hand
He will talk a universe of lies
Just to get you in his land

A perfect stranger
Trust him
Don't trust him

Piece by piece it's coming back
An imperfect picture of your past
Still confused it hits you
Way too early to understand
