Yes, I'm sittin' here thinkin'
Thinkin' about Miss Martha King
Well, I'm sitin' here thinkin'
Thinkin' about Miss Martha King
I'm in love with that woman
I ain't afraid to call her name

Lord, I did everythin' for you
Done everything I could
Everything that I did, you know it didn't do me no good

Miss Martha King
Do you think you're doin' me right?
Know you go out everyday, darlin'
And you don't come home tonight

Done everything, babe
Everything I could
Everything I did, you know
It didn't do me now good

Miss Martha King
Do you think you're doin' me right?
Know you go out everyday, baby
And still you want to fight
