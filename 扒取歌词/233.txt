And when I feel like I'm a victim, I will come running home to you, 
And I will weep like I will change, when I come running home to you 
I make you believe that I'm a changed girl, that I'm honest good and pure, 
Then I'll drag you through my shit again, 'cause I know you'll love me more 
I love how your world adores my gutter mind, this reflection says it all, 
So how I will let you go my baby, let you fall
And when I feel like I'm a victim, I will come running home to you, 
And I will weep like I will change, when I come running home to you 
And all of your rosy scanned up wrist bands, make me crucify you more 
With all of your blood, encrusted small finds, 
Kiss restraint and it's just cause so see the survivor in control now, 
I'm the whore you knew I was, look at the changed girl good pure, on Tracy's floor I'll come running, I'll come running I'll running right back to you [Repeat: x2]
