He's the king of rock and roll

Hot night summer in the city
Just above the smoking burn
Look out he's evil but he's pretty
And always gonna twist and turn

He's got the midnight madness
He's got control
He's the king of rock and roll

Bad blood and everybody knows it
But everybody doesn't care
He's got the only way to show it
They want to see it everywhere

He's got to give you fever
He'll scratch your soul
He's the king of rock and roll
The king of rock and roll

Bad boy always on the cover
Gettin' the story told
Fast fast one way or another
'Cause you never never never never never got old

He makes a special magic
You got control
You are the king of rock and roll

He's got the midnight madness
He's got a soul
'Cause he's the king of rock and roll
King of rock and roll
Rock and roll
Rock and roll
Rock and roll
Rock and roll
The king of rock and roll
Yeah!
