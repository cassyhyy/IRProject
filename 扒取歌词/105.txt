It's been a long time 
And I don't think about the show no more 
I wanna go home 
I wanna go home home home home home home home home 

it's been a long time 
And I don't think I like the road no more 
I wanna go home 
I wanna go home home home home home home home 

just relax 
And take the red one first 
So you can go back to work 
The band can go back to work work work work work 
Just relax 
And take the red one first 
So you can go back to work 
The band can go back to work work work work work 

I'm driving all night 
And I don't know where we were yesterday 
Is it time we play. which ways the stage? 

the crowd was on fire 
And I don't recognize a single face 
Oh by the way 
Can we stay at your place? 

just relax and take the red one first 
So you can go back to work 
The bay can go back to work work work work 
Just relax and take the red one first 
So you can go back to work 
The band can go back to work work work work work work 

I'm out of my mind 
And I don't care what the doctors say 
I'm not okay, I'm not okay k k k k k 

it's been a long time 
And I don't think you love me any more 
Pick up your phone 
I wanna go home 

just relax and take the red one first 
So you can go back to work the band 
Can go back to work work work work 

just relax and take the red one first 
So you can go back to work the band 
Can go back to work work work work work work work work work
