Once riding in old Baltimore, head filled,
Heart filled with glee
I saw a Baltimore an keep looking straight at me
Now I was eight and very small
And he was no whit bigger
And so I smiled but he poked out his tongue and called me a nigger
I saw the whole of Baltimore from May until December
Of all the things that happened there
That's all that I remember

Who's so scared
When I was fourteen I took a bus to San Francisco
I was full of hope and joy till this girl called me a boy
But I was already on my way so frightened to be gay
Just like in 1942 (1492) the world screaming,
"Something's wrong with you, Jew"

Who's so scared
But what I discover,
Lover after lover
There's nothing wrong with me
That's just a lie by society
So I start looking at the world we have
And while it's not all bad,
There's a lot of room for improvement
People of color and the gay movement

Who's so scared
Won't you explain to me that pain of your life
