young and dumb, truth and justice, fantasy 
fresh out of the academy 
five-time loser bust his head, make your day 
unless you're paid off then you look away 
do you thimk this corruption will ever stop 
what makes a person want to be a cop 
ran a red light, storm the house and bust the guy 
do you like to see his children cry 

pick up a hooker and take her for a little ride 
but get sucked off on the side 
sworn to serve and protect, forget the killing 
badge-wearing facist villain 
pissed in the street, you bust the guy 
do you like to see his children cry 

the badge means you suck 
a child lies there dead 
as you look back, what goes through your head 

young and tough, truth and justice, fantasy 
fresh out of the academy 
five-time loser bust his head, make your day 
unless you're paid off then you look away 
he burned a flag, storm the house and bust the guy 
do you like to see his children cry 
ran a red light, take her for a little ride 
but get sucked off on the side 

the badge means you suck 
a child lies there dead 
as you look back, what goes through your head 

talk to them, you can work it out 
you better not even try it 
you make a play for his gun 
they'll kill you say it was a riot 
RIIIIIIIOOOOOOOOOOTTTTTT 

what's behind the badge
