You're baby blue eyes that you promised tonight have got me in a mess
Why don't you do right and quit try to fight every time we get this stress
Your sugar daddy and your money well ain't gonna treat you right
You better do something baby whether wrong or right
Oh baby tonight's the night 

They say that love is a wonderful game and it happens everyday
Oh why oh why did you pick on me and make things happen this way
You got stars in one eye and lies in the other. Now which am I gonna believe
You better do something baby whether wrong or right
Oh baby tonight's the night
