We walk this earth
With fire in our hands
Eye for an eye
We are nemeses

We are with you
On this vicious, oh
Fight, fighting for freedom
United, we stand, we stand

We are a legion
Voice of anarchy
This is revolution
Creating new disorder

We are enemy
Divided of the system
Crossing democracy
Trading it in this time, yeah

One for all
All for one
We are strong
We are one

One for all
All for one
We are one (nemeses)

A malicious fever burns
In our hearts, In our veins
Your blood, My blood
All blood runs the same, the same

One for all
All for one
We are strong
We are one

One for all
All for one
We are one (nemeses)

We are nemeses

One for all
All for one
We are strong
We are one

One for all
All for one
We are one (nemeses)
