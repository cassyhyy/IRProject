Said you wouldn't be home late tonight
I gave up waiting at seventeen past midnight
Now my only company's a half full glass of wine

Leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
You leave me no choice but to plot my revenge

It's been so long
Since I've held your hand
You don't know how hard it can be

Thank God that I've been blessed with a patient mind
Cause' what I want to happen won't happen in a very long time
Now my only company's a half full glass of wine

Leave me no choice but to plot my revenge

It's been so long
Since I've held your hand
You don't know how hard it can be

You don't know how hard it can be
