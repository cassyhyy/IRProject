I just can't believe that you could go and play a game like this on me. 
Don't you know all of us so strong were did we go wrong. 
My friends they tell me that they seen you with another guy. 
Maybe why tell me why you do these things to me. 

I want you for me girl. 
I want you to be my love. 
Forever amour, cause your the one that I adore. 
If you love me let me know, and if you don't then let me go. 

And you will see the love we share will never be the same again. 
Baby if you think that I don't need you. 
Baby you are wrong and I was the fool for neglecting you. 
Forgive me girl and make it right again. 

I want you for me girl. 
I want you to be my love. 
Forever amour, cause your the one that I adore. 
If you love me let me know, and if you don't then let me go.
