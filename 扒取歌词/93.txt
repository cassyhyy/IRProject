I keep looking back for clues
They're all mine
I keep pulling back from truths
They're all mine to give
All mine to give
All mine to give
All mine to give
Lies to relieve and soothe
They're all mine
I would brake the holy rules for you
They're all mine to give
You've got your brakes on
I should run a mile from you
You're all mine to give
