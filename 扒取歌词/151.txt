Got this feeling lately
Something's on your mind
Your friends don't like me, baby
Wonder what they've said today
You know I love you
What's going on
Let's move on
Don't think about them
Know that they're wrong

You got to hold on 
No matter what they say
If you fail to be strong
They're gonna have it just their way

'Cause my heart ain't lying
No, my heart ain't lying

Is there something, baby?
Can you give a sign?
The stories they are telling
You know every word is a lie
You can believe me
My love is true
Let's move on
Those people only like to see you blue

You've got to hold on
No matter what they say
If you fail to be strong
They're gonna have it just their way

'Cause my heart ain't lying
No, my heart ain't lying
