When the moon's kinda dreamy 
Starry eyed and dreamy 
And nights are luscious and long 
If you're kinda lonely 
Then nothin' but the blues are brewin' 
The blues are brewin' 

When the wind through the window 
Blows across your pillow 
And tells you sleepin' is wrong 
If love goes a thirsting 
Till you feel like bursting 
Then nothing but the blues are brewin' 
The blues are brewin' 

Suppose you want somebody 
But you ain't got nobody 
You only get a gleam in your eyes 
Till somebody's found you 
And put their lovin' arms around you 
You got the feelin' you want to die 

But when the Lord up above you 
Send's someone to love you 
The blues are something you loose 
You're so busy doing 
The things that you're doing 
That love ain't got no time 
For brewin' the blues
