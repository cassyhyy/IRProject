Pick up the pieces in my life.
Holding on so tight calling on myself...
A time to rebuild, a time to pray.
To see how life could be.
I can't change the way I'am.
Speak to him for he is all that I know.
Now I begin a new day in my life.
Things are changing its out of control.
You stood beside me, but now you are no where to be found.
You stood by my side.
Lost in my thoughts I'm scared to speak out.
