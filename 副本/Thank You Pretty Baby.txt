I want to thank you pretty baby, for givin' your love to me
I want to thank you pretty baby, for givin' your love to me
My heart was locked up till you came and set it free

And I'm gonna love you pretty baby, love you till the end of time
And I'm gonna love you, love you till the end of time
I wanna thank your folks for making you so divine

Thank you for your loving ways
Oh, thank you, 'cause you've been so kind
I'm gonna take my time and just thank you, honey
Because you're mine, all mine, all mine

I'm gonna kiss you in the morning, kiss you in the evening too
And I'm gonna kiss you in the morning, kiss you in the evening too
I'm gonna spend my life loving no one but you
I'm gonna spend my life loving no one but you
