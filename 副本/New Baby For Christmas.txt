I want a new baby for Christmas
One with long pretty hair
I will stand and kiss her
And I know I'll never miss her
Because she will always be there

I don't want this old baby for Christmas
'Cause Santa you know she's not true
She kissed me on a hay ride
And took me for a sleigh ride
Then turned my white Christmas blue

The people are happy at Christmas time
The children are jumpin' all around
And I don't wan t to be left out of all the fun
So Santa don't you let me down

I want a new baby for Christmas
So don't you bring one that's untrue
She'll kiss me on a hay ride
Then take me on a sleigh ride
And turn my white Christmas to blue

I want a new baby for Christmas
One with long pretty hair
I will stand and kiss her
And I know I'll never miss her
Because she will always be there

I don't want this old baby for Christmas
'Cause Santa you know she's not true
She kissed me on a hay ride
And took me on a sleigh ride
Then turned my white Christmas to blue

The people are happy at Christmas time
The children are jumpin' all around
And I don't wan t to be left out of all the fun
So Santa don't you let me down

I want a new baby for Christmas
So don't you bring me one that's untrue
She'll kissed me on a hay ride
Then take me on a sleigh ride
And turned my white Christmas blue
