When we met we reminded
One another of an time we'd never lived in
Forgiving ourselves for being persons
That we'd maybe never been and we won't become again
What was the thoughts that I howl and echo that we shift and we shape each time that it's remembered

With my eyelids glued to the roof
I feel much better when there's little to prove
And this certainty until you're hurting me
You say it ain't always sunny but you got a new coat
And every song you sing I'm learning note for note
And I'm certainly right where I wanna be

I say hey hey darling that's what I needed to hear
You know it works much better and there's little to fear
And I hope it's true I'll always be with you
'Cause I'm certainly right where I wanna be

When all we learned from our mistakes is all we learn
We could get it some way about it maybe
If we always like advice we could let it be good to forget it
Till it ain't good to forget it

With my eyelids glued to the roof
I feel much better when there's little to prove
And this certainty until you're hurting me
You say it ain't always sunny but you got a new coat
And every song you sing I'm learning note for note
And I hope it's true I'll always be with you
I say hey hey darling that's what I needed to hear
You know it works much better and there's little to fear
And I hope it's true I'll always be with you
'Cause I'm certainly right where I wanna be
And I hope it's true I'll always be with you
'Cause I'm certainly right where I wanna be
