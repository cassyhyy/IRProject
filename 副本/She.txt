She knows about all the evil in this world
She knows what blackness lurks in our souls
She parts her lips and gives me a literary quip
Sharper and sweeter than any tails whip 

She makes me feel like a king
She is the reasoning that makes life swing 

She says come on and swing away from blue
She says don't yield to it's atmospheric hue
She's got the power to make things turn out right
Even in the darkest hour of the very blackest night 

She makes me feel like a king
She is the reasoning that makes life swing 

Eyes limpid pools of passion
Lips of deepest darkest damson
Fingers probing show white skin
Like a leather disciplinary
Looking rather predatory
Like an emissary of sin 

She knows we've got nothing more to lose
She knows we're dancing in a dead mans shoes
She says let's check out of this haunted hotel
Where all the corridors and doorways lead us straight to hell 

She makes me feel like a king
She is the reasoning that makes life swing
She makes me feel like a king
She is the reasoning that makes life swing 

She drags my world awake
