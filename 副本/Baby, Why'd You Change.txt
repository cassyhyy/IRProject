If I drove a truck
And I were waitress
And I ordered coffee
And I poured you some

Then you'd stop by
On your way sometime later
And if we arm-wrestled
I'd say that you won

My baby, ride easy
Ride high in the saddle all day
If your lovin' is good

And your cookin' ain't greasy
Hitch up the chuck wagon
And we'll ride away

If I were a winsome pale senorita
And I a bull-fighter, down in the sand
While the band kept on playing

That old Paso Doble
I'd throw you a flower
Would you take my hand?

My baby, ride easy
Ride high in the saddle all day
If your lovin' is good

And your cookin' ain't greasy
Hitch up the chuck wagon
And we'll ride away

If I ran the country
Yeah, I'd be your first lady
And fix up the white house
While you were away

Waitin' while I'm passing time
With world leaders
And later, together alone we might lay

My baby, ride easy
Ride high in the saddle all day
If your lovin' is good

And your cookin' ain't greasy
Hitch up the chuck wagon
And we'll ride away

My baby, ride easy
Ride high in the saddle all day
If your lovin' is good

And your cookin' ain't greasy
Hitch up the chuck wagon
And we'll ride away

Hitch up the chuck wagon
And we'll ride away
Hitch up the chuck wagon
And we'll ride away

Hitch up the chuck wagon
Hitch up the chuck wagon
Hitch up the chuck wagon
And we'll ride away
