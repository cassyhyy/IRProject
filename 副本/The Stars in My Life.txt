The stars in my life will shine like sunshine
If only I can see your smiling face
Though this universe collapses on occasion
The stars in my life will stay in place

Your kind of consciousness and holy vision
Lights up stars with a light so fine, so pure
This universal law needs no revision
The stars in my life will shine for sure

Though dark clouds may hide your lovin' powers
Darlin' all my stars will shine for you
The sky may cover up with thunder showers
But you can make my stars come shinning through

The stars in my life will shine like sunshine
If only I can see your smiling face
Though this universe collapses on occasion
The stars in my life will stay in place

Yes, the stars in my life will stay in place
