If I were a carpenter, and you were a lady
Would you marry me anyway? 
Would you have my baby?
If a tinker were my trade, would you still find me
Carrying the pots I made, following behind me?

Save my love through loneliness
Save my love through sorrow
I give you my only-ness
Give me your tomorrow

If I worked my hands in wood, would you still love me?
Answer me, babe: "yes I would, I'd put you above me"
If a miller were my trade, at a mill wheel grinding
Would you miss your color box, your soft shoes shining

Save my love through loneliness
Save my love through sorrow
I give you my only-ness
Give me your tomorrow

If I were a carpenter, and you were a lady
Would you marry me anyway? 
Would you have my baby?
Would you marry me anyway? 
Would you have my baby?
