I'm never fed up,
Because I'm made up,
Head full of loose change,
Because I'm rich and strange.

Holy moses, here we go again,
Headlong into some crazy scheme,

Success no more a pipe dream,
You must remember how,
Wow is to wow,
And a kiss is just too much.

From the cellar of my house comes a bellowing,
It's the tired and lonely tigers that I've kept there,
I can't imagine who the landlord's expecting,
They've been in their since June last year,
You must remember when,
You loved me like a friend,
And a kiss is just too much baby.

You must remember that,
I'm fat but I know where it's at,
And a kiss would be too much baby, let's get out of this town.
