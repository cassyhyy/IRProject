I am the Shadow Warrior from Creation!
And I stand amidst the flames with my sword in my hand
Chanting down the hypocrites by popular demand
You know I give you something the people, they want!

And if you want to reason
Sometimes you gotta stay out late
You got to stay up

I am
The Shadow Warrior, the ragamuffin soldier
Just a gwan with my big gun deh pon my shoulder
Firebomb fe warm your heart so you no fe get colder

As times getting dreader seh we must get bolder
Let's move together in the right direction
No matter where you're from, no matter your complexion
From ever nation and people of all religions

Just want food and shelter love and affection
Let's throw weh the bombs and put down the knives and guns
Though we all hate the war we got to love the veterans
Love the hookers though you hate the prostitution

'Cause the whole a we are sinners but we all know the right from wrong
I say we all know the right from wrong

And if you want to reason
Sometimes you gotta stay out late
You got to stay up

I creep through the shadows with my sword called reason
On my mission from creation to declare Open Season
On hatred, fear and jealousy and chop up the demons
As I slice through the darkness with my truth sword beaming

Do you remember the Garden of Eden?
I recall it so clearly and that's my inspiration
Just to remind you that's my motivation
'Cause together we got the power to arrange the situation

And if you want to reason
Sometimes you gotta stay out late
You got to stay up

I creep in silent fe go lick plenty shot
I got to move fast because the runnin's getting hot
So if you want to overstand, you fe follow the plot
You try to chop it up but it's just one dot

And every word I drop is like a gold ingot
'Cause you got to drop nuggets or just get off the pot
And every good deed is like a coin in a slot
If you play long enough, you're bound to hit the jackpot

I never try to tell you that I am what I'm not
So all politrickster a fe run like a rat
Some a dem try to bribe and some a extort
Some tek it for a game, some tek it for a sport

But no matter where they run dem nah go find a safe port
Them a go find themselves guilty in the ultimate court
Can't follow this if your attention is too short
'Cause Jah Jah is my shield and Jah Jah is my fort

And if you want to reason
Sometimes you gotta stay out late
You got to stay up

Hear wisdom cries out in the streets
Hear her voice in the square, her tears in the market
And out at the gates, in the city she utters her words
And she says, "How long will you simple ones love being simple?
How long will you fools hate knowledge?"
