Remember tumble weeds on an empty road
That coffee pot on a burnin' stove
The Christmas tree in a place a called home
That's what I miss the most

This drifting leaves fall to the ground
I scoop them up and I throw them down
I close my eyes and I start to count
The lonely people leaving town

And I feel like a monkey in winter
And you are a lizard in the sun
Yes I feel like a monkey in winter

Say hello to something new
Is what a friend told me to do
'Cause beggars can't be choosers and I can't afford to lose
We never touched we never kissed
We never loved though we thought we did
So I walked away and I called it quits
What the eyes don't see, you know the heart won't miss

But I feel like a monkey in winter
And you are a lizard in the sun
Yes I feel like a monkey in winter
And winter's just began

Remember summer long ago
The sun beats down, the air was clean
It came and went away
Things come and go
But do you, do you remember me?

Remember tumble weeds on an empty road
Coffee pot on a burnin' stove
The Christmas tree in a place a called home
That's what I miss the most

We never touched we never kissed
We never loved though we thought we did
So I walked away and I called it quits
What the eyes don't see, you know the heart don't miss

But I feel like a monkey in winter
And you are a lizard in the sun
Yes I feel like a monkey in winter
And it looks like winter's gone
