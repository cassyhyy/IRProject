I used to think that I was never good enough to cut it
I bought the lines that they were selling time after time
But when You opened up my mind and I refused to shut it
You brought me to a place where I could leave it all behind

Goodbye to my old life, I don't listen to those lies anymore
You've given me new life, loving You is what I was made for

It took a while for me to see but when I finally saw it
I knew I had to leave my sorted past in the past
I couldn't get there on my own, it was Your grace that taught it
My sin is covered by Your blood and I'm not looking back

You saw right through me, Your kindness drew me
Your mercy knew me, You love came to me
