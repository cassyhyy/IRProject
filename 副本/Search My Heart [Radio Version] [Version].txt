Search my heart
And search my soul
There's nothing else
That I want more

Shine Your light
And show Your face
In my life
Lord have Your way

With all my heart and all my soul
With all I am, Lord, I will follow You

Hear my cry
And hear my prayer
Draw me close
I know your near

So with all my heart and all my soul
With all I am, Lord, I will follow You

You took the cross, You took my shame
Restored my life, now I live to worship You

Without You I am nothing
Without You I am nothing
Without You I am nothing

So with all my heart and all my soul
With all I am, Lord, I will follow You
You took the cross, You took my shame
Restored my life, Lord I will follow You
Without You I am nothing
Without You I am nothing
Without You I am nothing

Without You I am nothing
Without You I am nothing
Without You I am nothing

Search my heart
And search my soul.
