Welcome to a world of pain
This is the day of your conviction,
Mortification
Dragged away from home on blood red nights
Slave to a brutal system forevermore
Forevermore
You are an orphan now
Adopted by the beast of war
The end of all your childhood dreams has come

[Chorus]
No more will you meet a smiling face
Now peace has left your sleep forever 
There are no arms to hold you 
There are no arms to wipe your tears

Constrained and forced to kill
These cruelties will haunt you
A life in combat
You'll feel you're inane, you're inner combat
And lies will form the future
You will forget your wishes
And nothing to embrace
But the rifle in your hands
Forevermore
You are an orphan now
Adopted 
By the beast of war
The end of all your 
Childhood dreams has come
A life of combat forevermore

[Chorus]

There are no arms to wipe your tears away
Yeah
There are no arms to hold you 
Peace has left your sleep
