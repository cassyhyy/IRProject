In A Sentimental Mood 
I can see the stars come thru my room
While your loving attitude
Is like a flame that lights the gloom
On the wings of ev'ry kiss 
Drift a melody so strange and sweet
In this sentimental bliss you make my 
Paradise complete
Rose pearls seem to fall
It's all like a dream to call you mine
My heart's lighter thing 
Since you made me this night a thing divine
In A Sentimental Mood 
I'm within a world so heavenly
For I never dreamt 
That you'd be loving sentimental me

Since you made me this night a thing divine
In A Sentimental Mood 
I'm within a world so heavenly
For I never dreamt 
That you'd be loving sentimental me
